<!-- React only has one html & we render all html via main.jsx into the "root" in this file. -->
<!-- Order of things below as I understand it (hopefully this is correct): -->
 <!-- 
1. INDEX.HTML - The browser opens the app and starts with the index.html file.
2. GOES TO ROOT WHERE APP IS STORED & RENDERED - That file has a spot where the React app will appear in root.
3. MAIN.JSX where JS & CSS & Html is rendered to the browser (?is this how this works)- It also says, “Run main.jsx.”
4. main.jsx loads index.css so the page knows the styles.
5. main.jsx then loads the App.
6. main.jsx shows App on the page in the root.
7. Because the styles were already loaded, everything in App uses them.
(This seems totally complicated to me; but I think this is the order of things.) -->
